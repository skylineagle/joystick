Detection Area Granularity
	•	What it is: Divides the frame into a grid of cells where motion is independently assessed  ￼.
	•	User Control: Two number-entry boxes or a combined “Grid” control specifying Columns × Rows (default 10×10)  ￼.
	•	Tip: Lower grid counts (e.g., 4×4) increase cell size, reducing CPU and noise but may miss small motions; higher counts (e.g., 16×16) improve precision at the cost of performance  ￼.

Motion Sensitivity
	•	What it is: The pixel-difference threshold to flag a cell as “in motion” (default 0.5)  ￼.
	•	User Control: A slider labeled Sensitivity from Low (0.1) to High (1.0).
	•	Tip: Increase sensitivity to detect subtler movements; decrease it to ignore slight changes like lighting ripples  ￼.

Activity Threshold
	•	What it is: The fraction of cells that must detect motion before reporting an event (default 0.01, i.e., 1 %)  ￼.
	•	User Control: A percentage slider labeled Activity Threshold (0 %–100 %).
	•	Tip: Lower thresholds pick up sparser motion; higher thresholds require more widespread change, reducing false positives  ￼.

Detection Cooldown
	•	What it is: Time in seconds after the last motion before sending a “motion end” event (default 5 s)  ￼.
	•	User Control: A numeric box labeled Cooldown Period (e.g., 2–10 s).
	•	Tip: Shorter cooldowns make recordings stop faster; longer ones keep sessions alive through brief pauses  ￼.

Notification Mode
	•	What it is: Controls whether messages are posted once per start/stop or on every motion frame (defaults: postallmotion=false, postnomotion=0)  ￼.
	•	User Control: A dropdown with options “Start/Stop Only”, “Every Frame”, and “Include No-Motion Alerts”.
	•	Tip: Use “Every Frame” for live dashboards; “Start/Stop Only” reduces bus traffic; “Include No-Motion” helps external systems detect idle periods  ￼.

Visual Overlay
	•	What it is: Draws colored borders over active cells and uses alpha blending (defaults: display=true, cellscolor=255,255,0, motioncellthickness=1, usealpha=true)  ￼.
	•	User Control:
	•	Checkbox “Show Overlay”
	•	Color picker “Cell Highlight Color”
	•	Slider “Outline Thickness” (or “Fill Cells” toggle)
	•	Checkbox “Use Transparency”
	•	Tip: Disabling overlays slightly reduces CPU; color and thickness help visibility on different backgrounds  ￼.

Region Masking
	•	What it is: Limits detection to specific cells or rectangular areas (properties motionmaskcellspos, motionmaskcoords, motioncellsidx)  ￼.
	•	User Control: An ROI drawing tool on the video preview or a list allowing “Mask Regions” defined by drag-select boxes.
	•	Tip: Focus on entryways or ignore foliage by masking only the needed areas  ￼.

Minimum Motion Duration
	•	What it is: Minimum consecutive frames required to trigger motion (property minimummotionframes, default 1)  ￼.
	•	User Control: Numeric stepper “Min Frames for Event” (e.g., 1–10 frames).
	•	Tip: Raising this filters out spurious single-frame changes like camera noise  ￼.

Data Logging
	•	What it is: Saves detected cell indices and timestamps to a file (properties datafile, datafileextension)  ￼.
	•	User Control: File-save dialog labeled “Log Motion Data” with format selection.
	•	Tip: Use for offline analytics or debugging event patterns  ￼.

UI Implementation Tips
	•	Sliders & Steppers: Use sliders for Sensitivity, Threshold, and Cooldown, with numeric readouts for precision  ￼.
	•	Checkboxes & Toggles: For Show Overlay, Use Transparency, Post Every Frame, and Include No-Motion Alerts  ￼.
	•	Color Picker: Let users pick highlight colors in RGB or hex format for Cell Overlay  ￼.
	•	ROI Tool: Offer a click-and-drag interface on live preview for masking regions, mapping directly to motionmaskcoords  ￼.
	•	Presets & Reset: Provide “Low Noise,” “Balanced,” and “High Sensitivity” presets mapping to recommended parameter sets to help beginners  ￼.

By abstracting the raw GStreamer properties into these intuitive controls, users can interactively optimize motion detection without delving into technical parameters.
